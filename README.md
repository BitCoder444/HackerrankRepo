## About this repo
- This repo is was made to hold solutions to existing [hackerrank][hck] problems.
- All of the solutions here worked 100% of the time at the time they were made.
However, the problems on hackerrank may have been update or changed. Therefore, the solutions here may not work for you.
- The naming convention of each file is simple: take the name of the problem and add
.java to it. That way, when it comes time to look for the original problem, you
will be able to use the name of the file.
- Each file may or may no contain comments on the original problem.

# Types of programming
- **Procedural programming**: used to execute a sequence of statements which lead to a result. This type of programming anguage uses multiple varialbes, heavy loops and other elements, which seperates them from functional programming languages. Functions of procedural language may control variables, other than function's value returns. Ex. printing out information.
- **Functional programming**: uses stored data, frequently avoiding loops in favor of recursive functions. The functional prgramming primary focus is on the return values of functions, and side effects suggests that storing state are powerfully discouraged. Ex. in a exceedingly pure useful language, if a function is termed, it is expected that the function not modify or perform and o/p. It may, however, build algorithmic calls and alter the parameters of these calls. Functional languages are usually easier and make it easier to understand abstract issues, however they will be further from the machine. This means that their programming odel makes it difficult to know precisely, but the code is decoded into machine language (which are often problematic for system programming).
- **OOP Language**: This language views the world as a groupd of objects that have nternal data and external accessing parts of that data. THe aim is to think about the fault by seperating it into a collection of objects that offer services which can be used to solve a specific problem. One of the main principle of OOP language is encapsualtion that everything an object will need must be inside of the object. This language also emphasizes reusabilty through inheritance and the capacity to spread current implementations without having to change a great deal of code by using polymorphism. 
- **Logic programming language**:
