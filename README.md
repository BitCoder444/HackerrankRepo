## About this repo
- This repo is was made to hold solutions to existing hackerrank problems.
- All of the solutions here worked 100% of the time at the time they were made.
However, the problems on hackerrank may have been update or changed. Therefore, the solutions here may not work for you.
- The naming convention of each file is simple: take the name of the problem and add
.java to it. That way, when it comes time to look for the original problem, you
will be able to use the name of the file.
- Each file may or may no contain comments on the original problem.
